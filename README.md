  The goal of this statusbar is to provide a highly customizable and extensible statusbar for zellij. Single
  modules can be formatted separately. Due to the widget structure new modules can be created with ease.

## üöÄ Installation

Download the latest binary in the github releases. Place it somewhere, zellij is able to access it. Then the
plugin can be included by referencing it in a layout file, e.g. the default layout one.

You could also refer to the plugin guide from zellij, after downloading the binary: [https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugin-loading)

Please ensure, that the configuration is correct.

‚ö†Ô∏è **In case you experience any crashes or issues, please in the first step try to clear the cache! (`$HOME/.cache/zellij/` for Linux, `$HOME/Library/Caches/org.Zellij-Contributors.Zellij/` on macOS)**

Sometimes, especially when updating zjstatus, it might come to caching issues, which can be resolved by clearing it. Please keep in
mind, that it will also clear the cache for running sessions and revokes granted permissions for plugins.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Installation with nix flake

Add this repository to your inputs and then with the following overlay to your packages.
Then you are able to install and refer to it with `pkgs.zjstatus`. When templating the
config file, you can use `${pkgs.zjstatus}/bin/zjstatus.wasm` as the path.

```nix
  inputs = {
    # ...

    zjstatus = {
      url = "github:dj95/zjstatus";
    };
  };


  # define the outputs of this flake - especially the home configurations
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, zjstatus, ... }@inputs:
  let
    inherit (inputs.nixpkgs.lib) attrValues;

    overlays = with inputs; [
      # ...
      (final: prev: {
        zjstatus = zjstatus.packages.${prev.system}.default;
      })
    ];
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration can be performed in the layout file, when importing the plugin. Here's a short example.

```kdl

layout {
    pane split_direction="vertical" {
        pane
    }

    pane size=1 borderless=true {
        plugin location="file:target/wasm32-wasi/debug/zjstatus.wasm" {
            format_left  "{mode} #[fg=#89B4FA,bold]{session} {tabs}"
            format_right "{command_git_branch} {datetime}"
            format_space ""

            border_enabled  "false"
            border_char     "‚îÄ"
            border_format   "#[fg=#6C7086]{char}"
            border_position "top"

            hide_frame_for_single_pane "true"

            mode_normal  "#[bg=blue] "
            mode_tmux    "#[bg=#ffc387] "

            tab_normal   "#[fg=#6C7086] {name} "
            tab_active   "#[fg=#9399B2,bold,italic] {name} "

            command_git_branch_command     "git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD"
            command_git_branch_format      "#[fg=blue] {stdout} "
            command_git_branch_interval    "10"
            command_git_branch_rendermode  "static"

            datetime        "#[fg=#6C7086,bold] {format} "
            datetime_format "%A, %d %b %Y %H:%M"
            datetime_timezone "Europe/Berlin"
        }
    }
}
```

In order to start using zjstatus you need to specify the widgets you'd like to use under the `format_left` and/or `format_right`
configuration. Formatting can be done with `#[..]`, while widgets and properties are surrounded by `{..}`.
The blank space between the left and the right part can be colored with `format_space`.

### üîß General configuration

This section describes some general configuration for zjstatus.

#### Hide pane frames for tabs single panes

The option `hide_frame_for_single_pane` will toggle the pane frames depending on how many panes (not plugin panes) are shown.
This will effectively hide the frame border, when only one pane, like an editor, is shown. Pane frames are toggled as soon
as there is another pane created.

#### Border for the bar

When hiding the pane frames, zjstatus might blend in too well with the background and opened panes since zellij won't draw
the border for non-selectable plugins. Therefore zjstatus provides its own border, that can be activated and customized.
Most important, the pane height for the plugin **must be set to 2**. Otherwise zjstatus won't be able to draw it. For top
bar configurations the position of the border is also implemented.

```kdl
border_enabled  "true"           // "true" | "false" for activating the bar
border_char     "‚îÄ"              // character used for drawing the bar
border_format   "#[fg=#6C7086]"  // format specifier for theming
border_position "top"            // "top" | "bottom" for the border position relative to the bar
```

### üé® Formatting and theming

Text and modules can be themed with directives in `#[]`. These directives tell zjstatus to print the following
text in the specified format. It will reset the format on any new directives or after rendering a widget.
Options can be combined with a `,`, when they occur in the same bracket.

Possible formatting options are:

| name   | value                     | example       | description      |
|--------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| fg     | hex or ansi color or name | `#[fg=#ffffff]` | foreground color |
| bg     | hex or ansi color or name | `#[bg=#ffffff]` | background color |
| bold   | none                      | `#[bold]`       | bold text        |
| italic | none                      | `#[italic]`     | italic text      |

Colors can be specified either by giving the hexadecimal rgb value or the ansi color (0..255). To simplify the specification
by ansi color codes, the color name can also be used. They refer to the configured color in the terminal.

### üß± Widgets

zjstatus contains the following widgets with their respective config.

#### command

**Handle** `{command_NAME}`

‚ö†Ô∏è  zellij 0.39.0 or newer is needed!

This widget is able to run arbitrary commands and prints the result. Keep in mind, that it
runs **just** the command **not** in a shell. If you'd like to use a shell, please make
sure you specify it and properly use it for running your command. Since the command widget
should be able to run multiple commands, it behaves a bit different than the other widgets.
Therefore the command need to have a name in form of e.g. `{command_pwd}` or `{command_git_branch}`. The following
options can be provided per named command.

```kdl
# the command that should be executed
command_NAME_command  "bash -c \"pwd | base64\""

# themeing and format of the command
command_NAME_format   "#[fg=blue, bg=black] {exit_code} {stdout} {stderr}"

# interval in seconds, between two command runs
command_NAME_interval "1"

# render mode of the command. ["static", "dynamic", "raw"]
#
# "static"  :: format the command with the given format from the config and don't
#              consider any other formatting directives
# "dynamic" :: format the command based on the command output. When the command
#              output contains formatting strings for zjstatus, zjstatus will
#              try to render them. This might lead to unexpected behavior, in case
#              the formatting is not correct.
# "raw"     :: do not apply any formatting. This can be used to properly render
#              ansi escape sequences from the command output.
command_NAME_rendermode "static"
```

#### datetime

**Handle** `{datetime}`

Print the date and/or time by the given format string. Due to the WASM sandbox
the timezone cannot be determined from the system. You can configure it
with the `datetime_timezone` parameter. Choose the according string from the
chrono documentation: [https://docs.rs/chrono-tz/latest/chrono_tz/enum.Tz.html](https://docs.rs/chrono-tz/latest/chrono_tz/enum.Tz.html).
For the `datetime_format` syntax, you can also check the specifiers table 
available in the chrono documentation:
[https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html).

```kdl
# theme formatting for colors. Datetime output is printed in {format}.
datetime        "#[fg=#6C7086,bold] {format} "

# format of the date
datetime_format "%A, %d %b %Y %H:%M"

# timezone to print
datetime_timezone "Europe/Berlin"
```

#### mode

**Handle** `{mode}`

Indicate the current active mode in zellij. Each mode can be configured individually. If a mode is not configured, it will
fall back to the format of `mode_normal`, if `mode_default_to_mode` is not specified or invalid. Otherwise it will use the
format referenced in `mode_default_to_mode`, if the format for a mode is unspecified. The name of the mode can be used
in the `{name}` variable.

```kdl
mode_normal        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_locked        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_resize        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_pane          "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_tab           "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_scroll        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_enter_search  "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_search        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_rename_tab    "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_rename_pane   "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_session       "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_move          "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_prompt        "#[bg=#89B4FA] {name} "
mode_tmux          "#[bg=#ffc387] {name} "

mode_default_to_mode "tmux"
```

#### session

**Handle** `{session}`

Print the current session name. This module cannot be configured. For formatting, please put the Formatting
sequence right before the handle in `format_left` or `format_right`.

#### swap layout

**Handle** `{swap_layout}`  
**Click behavior** Switch to the next swap layout

Print the active swap layout. This module cannot be configured. For formatting, please put the Formatting
sequence right before the handle in `format_left` or `format_right`.

#### tabs

**Handle** `{tabs}`  
**Click behavior** Navigate to the tab that got clicked

Print a list of current tabs. The name of the tab can be used with `{name}` in the config. The active tab will
default to the normal formatting, if not configured.
With `{index}` the tab position can also be used. With `{floating_total_count}` you can print the total amount
of floating panes.

```kdl
# formatting for inactive tabs
tab_normal              "#[fg=#6C7086] {index} :: {name} "
tab_normal_fullscreen   "#[fg=#6C7086] {index} :: {name} [] "
tab_normal_sync         "#[fg=#6C7086] {index} :: {name} <> "

# formatting for the current active tab
tab_active              "#[fg=#9399B2,bold,italic] {name} "
tab_active_fullscreen   "#[fg=#9399B2,bold,italic] {name} [] "
tab_active_sync         "#[fg=#9399B2,bold,italic] {name} <> "

# separator between the tabs
tab_separator           "#[fg=#6C7086,bg=#181825] | "
```

## üöß Development

Make sure you have rust and the `wasm32-wasi` target installed. If using nix, you could utilize the nix-shell
in this repo for obtaining `cargo` and `rustup`. Then you'll only need to add the target with
`rustup target add wasm32-wasi`.

With the toolchain, simply build `zjstatus` with `cargo build`. Then you are able to run the example configuration
with `zellij -l plugin-dev-workspace.kdl` from the root of the repository.
